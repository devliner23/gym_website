                    <h1>Humble Beginnings</h1>
                    <p>Hans Globo was born March 15, 1905 and was the product of hard-working, blue-collar mine workers from Colorado. Hans, from an early age, had a major fascination and 
                    passion for physical exercise. With only $10,000 and three employees, he started Globo Gym in Irvine, California in 1926. Hans had one goal in mind: create an affordable gym for the local neighborhood he grew up in and loved. 
                    Little did he know, his lifelong passion would soon turn into a long and prosperous business career. Shortly after his first gym in 1926, Hans opened up 10 more neighborhood gyms around the LA suburban area by 1930.

                    <h1>Success of the Serpent</h1>
                    <p>Hans' success saw no brakes as he continued to open more and more gyms, farther and farther from the Greater LA area. By the year 1945, 
                    Globo Gym had over 100 locations in 40 cities, in over 10 states. Hans' incredible marketing techniques and his likeability from everyone he met 
                    catapulted the Globo Gym name into success known from other national fitness centers. Hans was officially an elite in the fitness industry.

                    <h1>Globo Today</h1>
                    <p>Today, Hans' grandson, White Goodman runs the Globo Gym Corp.&copy which owns and operates over 1,000 gyms internationally. 
                        White Goodman has changed the culture of the Globo lifestyle for the better. Since his leadership, membership fees have risen over 1000%, applicants are now judged on physical and 
                        mental atttributes to make sure they are Globo Gym Corp&copy material. If not, they are ghosted and just flat out ignored untilt hey get the picture, but for the select few that make 
                        the cut, a highly toxic and judgemental fitness center can be your home!
